      "CMake is an open-source, cross-platform family of tools designed to build, test and package software. CMake is used to control the software compilation process using simple platform and compiler independent configuration files, and generate native makefiles and workspaces that can be used in the compiler environment of your choice. The suite of CMake tools were created by Kitware in response to the need for a powerful, cross-platform build environment for open-source projects such as ITK and VTK.": [ 1 ]
      "The GNU Arm Embedded Toolchain is a ready-to-use, open-source suite of tools for C, C++ and assembly programming.  The GNU Arm Embedded Toolchain targets the 32-bit Arm Cortex-A, Arm Cortex-M, and Arm Cortex-R processor families.  The GNU Arm Embedded Toolchain includes the GNU Compiler (GCC) and is available free of charge directly from Arm  for embedded software development on Windows, Linux, and Mac OS X operating systems.": [ 0 ]
